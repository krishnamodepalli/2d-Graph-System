# 2d-Graph-System

This cpp project is a demonstration of rectangular graph system where we work 
with Points, Lines, etc.. In this project all of them (I think) were 
implemented in code language where we can use Points, Lines and we can 
manipulate them and do calculations on them, treat each one of them as an 
object like any other object in cpp.  

**This project is a pure demonstration of 2d-Graph-System in cpp language**. 
All the documentation for the project is available in the `Usage.md` file with 
all the details and how-to-use descriptions.  


No `makefile`s are included in the repository, so that you can use the code 
as you wish. As far as my testings on the project, all the source files are 
correctly organised and there are no compiling issues or any other errors. All 
the source files and the output should compile & work well.  


## Compiling and executing
```terminal
$ g++ src/*.cpp -o main
$ ./main
```

The above example should work well if you find any difficulties about using 
them, this should work fine.
