# 2d-Graph-System

This cpp project is a demonstration of rectangular graph system where we work
with Points, Lines, etc.. In this project all of them (I think) were
implemented in code language where we can use Points, Lines and we can
manipulate them and do calculations on them, treat each one of them as an
object like any other object in cpp.  

**This project is a pure demonstration of 2d-Graph-System in cpp language**.
All the documentation for the project is available in the `Usage.md` file with
all the details and how-to-use descriptions.  


For the first time in this repository, a `Makefile` is included. This usually
creates directories for the project and compile code with both `debug` and
`release` modes (with Optimization enabled on `release` mode) and creates a
`bin` directory where all the binaries of the project will be placed.
By the way, this `Makefile` is generated by AI(ChatGPT).  

## Compiling and executing
```terminal
# for `debug` mode
$ make debug
$ ./bin/debug/main

# for `release` mode
$ make release
$ ./bin/release/main
```

The above example should work well, if you find any difficulties about using
them, feel free to ask in comments or issues.
